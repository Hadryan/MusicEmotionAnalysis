# SpeechEmotionAnalysis
## This repository is my trial of emotion analysis using musics. I have uploaded my webscraper for scraping musics from <a>https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/</a>
## The scraped data contains seven classes. If you want to scrape the data :
1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal
3. `cd` into the repository
4. run `python3 main.py`
5. if you want to increase the speed of the download, just change the buffer size in Downloader.py
